          SCS believes that socio-economic problems are fundamentally rooted in
          wrong cultural ideas and beliefs that are contrary to the truth,
          eventually leading to unhealthy lifestyles and sin. Change begins with
          altering such wrong societal mindsets. Children are a fundamental part
          of society, and if not properly cared for, they can become victims and
          a major source of crisis. SCS believes God has a special purpose for
          young children in Ethiopia, similar to how Jesus used a childâ€™s food
          to bless many (John 6:6).
