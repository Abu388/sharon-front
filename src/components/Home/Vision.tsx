            SCS aims to help children enjoy their childhood and experience the
            glory of God by nurturing their spiritual life and helping them to
            become heroic disciples of Christ. The overarching vision is to see
            children and young adults in Ethiopia use their freedom to come to
            the Lord and grow holistically (spiritually, physically,
            emotionally, and socially).
